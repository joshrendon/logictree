Logictree is a Python toolkit and IR for parsing, lowering, and analyzing SystemVerilog logic:
- Lower `case → if → mux` with equivalence checks
- Canonicalize to primitive gates; depth & gate-count analysis
- Graphviz rendering, JSON export, and CLI

## Install (dev)
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## CLI
`logictree --help`

## Run Tests (fast set)
`pytest -q -m "unit or props or diff"`

Philosophy and Use Case

This tool is designed for symbolic logic analysis, enabling:
* Pre-synthesis decoder optimization
* RTL logic depth estimation
* Visualization of complex Boolean expressions
* Research and educational insight into logic structure

It’s especially suited to analyzing RISC-V instruction decoders, and will serve as the foundation 
for future articles, tutorials, and FPGA validation studies.
