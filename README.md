## SV_AST: SystemVerilog Static Logic Analyzer — Project Status Summary

This project is an open-source Python-based symbolic analysis toolchain for SystemVerilog logic expressions and RTL constructs.
It parses a subset of SystemVerilog using ANTLR4 and converts it into an internal symbolic intermediate representation (IR) called LogicTree.
The LogicTree IR enables structural analysis, visualization, and back end transformations.

Supported Features:
🎯 Core Parser (ANTLR4-based)
   - [x] SystemVerilog subset grammar implemented in SystemVerilogSubset.g4
   - [x] Supports module, input, output, assign statements
   - [x] Supports if and case statements (basic form)
   - [x] Supports binary expressions: &, |, ^, ~, ==, !=, bitvector literals (e.g., 3'b101)
   - [x] Partial support for ~, parentheses, and unary operations
🧩 AST + IR Pipeline
   - [x] Full AST generation via ANTLR4 parse tree to custom Python AST classes
   - [x] LogicTree IR representation for symbolic Boolean structure
   - [x] Node types: And, Or, Not, Xor, Eq, Id, Const
   - [x] Bitvector equality comparisons expanded to logic trees (e.g., funct3 == 3'b000)
   - [x] Depth-aware analysis (tracks maximum path depth from inputs)
🖼️ Visualization
   ✅ to_dot() and Graphviz .png/.svg rendering of logic trees
   ✅ Balanced reduction option for n-input AND/OR gates (--balanced)
   ✅ Tagging support for constant-time reductions
🧪 CLI Tooling
   ✅ CLI frontend (cli.main) supports:
   - [x] File parsing
   - [x] LogicTree analysis
   - [x] DOT and image export (--to_dot, --to_png, --to_svg)
   - [x] Debug logging (--debug-log)
   - [x] Flattening/balancing options
📦 Extensible Infrastructure
   ✅ Visitors and Lowering Passes:
   - AST visitor extracts assign expressions to LogicTree
   - Partial case → if lowering in progress
   - IR collector for introspection, future Verilog or JSON export

Philosophy and Use Case

This tool is designed for symbolic logic analysis, enabling:
* Pre-synthesis decoder optimization
* RTL logic depth estimation
* Visualization of complex Boolean expressions
* Research and educational insight into logic structure

It’s especially suited to analyzing RISC-V instruction decoders, and will serve as the foundation 
for future articles, tutorials, and FPGA validation studies.

Generating new visitor modules from grammar:
cd grammar/
antlr -Dlanguage=Python3 <grammar.g4>
antlr -Dlanguage=Python3 -visitor <grammar.g4>  # To generate a visitor file
